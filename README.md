# My markdown to html converter

This program takes a text file using a subset of markdown formatting and converts it into an HTML file.

Writing this program used a test-driven approach, with some 46 tests being created before the program was considered minimally-acceptable.

There is also a repo for an [earlier version](https://github.com/CJoubertLocal/my_markdown_to_html_converter_linked_list/) which used a linked list.
